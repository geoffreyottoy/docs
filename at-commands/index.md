## Serial Communication

When the motherboard is powered on (due to a power cycle), it starts listening (serial) for 10 seconds.
If there is no incoming data in that window, the serial communication is stopped.
A power cycle is required, to re-enter this phase, so it can receive AT commands.

All AT commands changing the configuration of the sensors, will be stored in non-volatile memory.
To push these configurations to sensors, the `close` command needs to be executed.
This will also halt the serial communication, as the motherboard does not process any incoming data.


## Data Format and Identifiers
Sensor id, sensor type and motherboard id -> hex string with fixed size
Poll interval, threshold levels and metric specifiers all decimals (ascii string).
