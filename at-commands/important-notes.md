Goal of this section is to point out some important aspects when configuring the node

	* no "hot-plugging" of sensor boards
	* once configured, sensor boards can be connected to a different connector of the same motherboard (rearrange them).
	* However, when a new sensor-board is added, the complete configuration is removed and needs to be done anew.
